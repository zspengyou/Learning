Hamming priority function. 
	The number of blocks in the wrong position, plus the number of moves made so far to get to the search node. 
	Intuitively, a search node with a small number of blocks in the wrong position is close to the goal, 
	and we prefer a search node that have been reached using a small number of moves.
Manhattan priority function. 
	The sum of the Manhattan distances (sum of the vertical and horizontal distance) from the blocks to their goal positions,
	 plus the number of moves made so far to get to the search node.
