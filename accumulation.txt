use global varible (instance variable), to reduce the number of variable passed in.
think twice about what to return 
think twice about how to update the result 
	* compare with current node or need to compare with root.left root.right
	* when min, greater than => update

subString(startIndex, startIndex+length  or endIndex + 1)

for loop has two lines, the second one is not included in
greater than or less than 
nums[i] or nums[j]
nums[len-1] or nums[len - i -1]
loop => i++
